# Gesture recognition mouse using Computer Vision & AI 
 This project involves developing a virtual mouse using hand gestures as inputs, leveraging computer vision and artificial intelligence. By utilizing a webcam, the system tracks and interprets hand movements and gestures in real-time to control the mouse pointer on a screen. It employs image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize different hand positions and gestures, translating them into corresponding mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, or scrolling. This project aims to create an intuitive and touchless way to interact with computers, enhancing accessibility and providing a novel user experience.

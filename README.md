# Hand Gesture mouse Control System using openCV and mediapipe

## Overview
This project leverages hand gesture recognition to control various system functions using Python. By tracking hand movements and finger positions through a webcam, users can perform actions such as adjusting volume, scrolling, and switching between windows. The system utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks, PyAutoGUI for automation, and the Pycaw library to control audio settings.

## Features
Volume Control: Adjust system volume by changing the distance between the index finger and thumb.
Mouse Movement: Move the mouse cursor based on the position of the index finger.
Clicking: Perform mouse clicks with a pinch gesture (index and middle fingers up).
Scrolling: Scroll up or down with specific hand gestures.
Window Management: Switch between windows using a four-finger gesture.
Pause/Play: Tap the space bar using a thumb and pinky gesture.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
OpenCV
NumPy
PyAutoGUI
Pycaw
HandTrackingModule (Custom module for hand tracking)
